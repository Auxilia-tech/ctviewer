"""
This module provides key components for rendering in the CTViewer package.

- `RendererCallbacks`: A class that handles rendering callbacks.
- `IsoSurfer`: A class that performs isosurface extraction.
- `RayCaster`: A class that performs volume rendering using ray casting.
- `Renderer`: A class that manages the rendering process.
- `Slicer`: A class that performs volume slicing.

These components are essential for visualizing CT scan data in the CTViewer package.
